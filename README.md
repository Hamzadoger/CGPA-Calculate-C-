Here is an example of a C++ program that calculates the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) of a student:
The program prompts the user to enter the number of courses, and for each course, it prompts the user to enter the credit hours and the grade point.
It then calculates the CGPA by dividing the total points by the total credit hours.
It then prints the CGPA on the screen.
It's a basic program, you can modify it as per your requirement for example, you can add a function for validation of inputs, or add a function to check the grade point and credit hours are in the range you expect.

Note that the above program assumes that the grade points and credit hours are in a specific range and format. You may want to add validation to ensure that the input is in the correct format and within an acceptable range.
